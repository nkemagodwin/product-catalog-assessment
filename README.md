Deployment guide

npm run eject
Advanced Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è

Warning: This is permanent! Once ejected, you cannot revert.

Removes the single build dependency from your project

Copies all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project

Gives you full control over configuration at the cost of maintaining build tools

All commands except eject continue to work, but now reference your local config files

When to consider ejecting:

When you need complete customization of build tools

For advanced configurations not supported by Create React App

Only if you're comfortable maintaining build configurations
